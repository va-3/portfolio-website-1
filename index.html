                    <p class="about-paragraph">
                        I've always been drawn to two things: understanding people and pushing myself to grow. In high school, I was varsity golf captain my senior year, leading my team while also competing in basketball and track. But I wasn't just focused on athletics. I founded a Neuroscience and STEM club chapter at my school because I wanted to bridge the gap between competition and curiosity, between discipline and discovery. That same drive showed up in my first jobs. As a server at Rainforest Cafe and a Sales Associate at Aqua Tots Swim School, I learned that the best outcomes come from genuinely listening to people. Whether I was helping a family celebrate a moment or working with parents to get their kids comfortable in the water, I realized connection matters as much as effort. Sports taught me to show up and do the work. Those early jobs taught me why the work matters.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-paragraph">
                        When I got to UT Dallas to study Computer Information Systems, I kept that momentum going. I joined Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and, within months, earned a spot on the executive committee as Historian. There, I organized events, built connections with alumni, and helped raise money for our philanthropy, the Ability Experience, while attending national conferences that pushed me to grow as a leader in my community. During my time at Vivint Smart Home, I was in a technical sales role, but something clicked. I wasn't interested in just presenting solutions anymore. I wanted to build them. That realization changed everything. I started diving into different industries, building applications not because I had to, but because I was genuinely curious about how technology could improve daily life. Mental health technology became one of those areas where I saw real impact potential. Now, as a Full Stack Engineer at PeerBridge, I'm building an AI-powered mental health platform serving users across multiple countries. Every line of code connects to someone's wellbeing, and that responsibility drives me the same way leading my golf team, founding that STEM club, and serving my fraternity brothers did. I strive every day to be a servant leader, to keep learning and evolving with the same work ethic sports taught me, and to never lose sight of why I build in the first place. It's about serving people.
